          <p class="cursive">Hi! I'm Stuart.
          <p>I'm the soon-to-be Graphics Director at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html" target="_blank">The New York Times Opinion</a>. We'll be trying to figure out visual opinionizing.
            <!-- What is visual opinionizing? Since you're here, I can say this: we'll be trying to figure that out. It's a new thing since Opinion hasn't traditionally received these kinds of resources. Generally, we'll be using data to form new arguments and combine all forms of visual storytelling to find and tell new stories. And there'll be a bit of augmenting existing work too, I'm sure. But there's tons of great opportunity. And yes we'll be hiring. -->
          <p>For now, I'm the soon-to-be-former Graphics Director at <a target="_blank" href="http://graphics.wsj.com/">The Wall Street Journal</a>. It's been tons of fun working with this great big team.
            <!-- My first-ever project for WSJ was a map of bars where you could watch the World Cup. Those were different times. If I can lay claim to any kind of legacy, it would probably be pushing the team more aggressively towards visual journalism, that big bucket of reporting and data analysis that preferences strong stories over flashiness. I tried to move our staff closer to the core of reporting and pushed against treating this work as subservient to text. "Story first" was actually my team motto. -->
